NAME
  daemontools-plack-runner - Shell Script To Bootstrap Plack Apps From Daemontools

DESCRIPTION
  Generic run file to execute plack with daemontools

ASSUMPTIONS
  * ALL perl dependencies are available via a local::lib
    directory (default extlib)
  * Requires daemontools (duh)
  * Requires Plack (duh)
  * Requires local::lib 
      In many cases, local::lib MUST BE INSTALLED GLOBALLY,
      NOT your ~/perl5. If in doubt, install globally.
      Otherwise, use PERL5LIB in your env dir
  * Requires Server::Starter (start_server script)

USAGE SCENARIO
  How /I/ use this with daemontools:
    (1) mkdir /var/lib/svscan/myapp
    (2) copy/symlink this file to /var/lib/svscan/myapp
    (3) create /var/lib/svscan/myapp/catalyst.yaml
    (4) mkdir /var/lib/svscan/myapp/env 
    (5) this env dir should contain files that have your settings.
        for example, if you want to use hoge.psgi as your PSGI app,
        create a file named PSGI_APP with "hoge.psgi" as its content.
    (6) ln -s /var/lib/svscan/myapp /etc/service  (or /service)

  How /I/ use this in a Standalone deployment (for testing)
    (1) create a directory like myapp/deploy (doesn't really matter)
    (2) copy/symlink this file to /var/lib/svscan/myapp
    (3) mkdir /var/lib/svscan/myapp/env
    (4) create env files like (5) above
    (5) ./deploy/run   woot!
